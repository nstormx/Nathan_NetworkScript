Put the Network_Properties file into the /home/user/bin/ folder and then use the command "chmod +x Network_Properties" to enable executing of the file.
Now to run the file it self you can do it either in the bin folder with ./Network_Properties or from anywhere with $HOME/bin/./Network_Properties and then the output will always be in your /home/user/ folder labeled as Network_Info_Date.
